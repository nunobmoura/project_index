A little background info about me: I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, where I lived more than 20 years of my life. In Brazil we all speak Portuguese, everyday and everywhere, and less than 3% of the population speak English fluently.

Brazilians take mandatory English classes in school, but for a number of reasons — including a quite broken national educational system and the lack of exposure to the language on a regular basis — we don’t learn it enough. We think we do; quality standards are so low in certain regions that one can really quickly be considered an advanced student in language schools. But when you move to an English-speaking country and English becomes your primary language, you very soon start to realize how your “5-star”, “advanced proficiency” in English can only get you so far.

We do get to listen to American music on the radio and watch Hollywood movies somewhat frequently (dubbed on TV, subtitled in theaters). But when you lack grammar, vocabulary, and/or cultural references, it all tends to sound like gibberish or background noise.

And then you get a job in UX.

*“Normalmente se tem como base a aniquilação de alguns requisitos como uso de cores e imagens reais, utilizando-se somente blocos para representar os espaços e tipos de conteúdo. Quanto mais detalhada a informação, melhor a interpretação do especialista. Wireframes também podem servir como guia para que os desenvolvedores saibam o posicionamento correto dos objetos.”*

The paragraph above is an excerpt from an article, written in Portuguese, about the role of wireframes in the design process. I’m sure you are smart enough to grasp a few words here and there, even without ever been exposed to the language. And there’s a big chance that, if you’re reading this article, you already know what wireframes are used for.

But what if that was the only way you could learn more about a discipline you have a lot of passion for, and very little experience with?

> Every single UX blog or website that my mentors would send me (“you should add this one to your Google Reader!”) was written in English. Every. Single. One.

Back in 2005, when I started working in UX at a big digital agency in Brazil, content available in Portuguese about our discipline was close to zero. Every single [UX blog or website](https://uxdesign.cc/ux-sites-and-blogs-780a304766ee "UX Sites and Blogs"){:target="_blank"} that my mentors would send me (“you should add this one to your Google Reader!”) was being written in English.

Aside from the headache that reading and listening to a foreign language for several hours a week brings, it was also a matter of depth: the smarter the writing, the harder it is for a non-native speaker to understand all the subtleties and smart thinking hidden in between the lines.

The lack of fluency in English was holding me back in UX.

And I *had* to do something to change that.

## Understanding expressions

- “…and run a ballpark estimate to avoid surprises later on…”
- “…to set up a touch base with the team every morning…”
- “…make sure you cover all the bases in the design process…”
- “…be able to handle curveballs right off the bat…”

It was not just about individual words. When you’re born in the nation of soccer, reading expressions like the ones above can be disorienting.

It’s what I like to call “Baseball English”. After a couple years living and breathing the American culture, you learn to understand, appreciate, and respect each of these expressions.

The fact is: cultural references are more embedded in our writing than we think. The vast majority of UX articles I was able to find online had been written by designers, authors and thought leaders born and raised in the United States, and it was inevitable to stumble upon references from American books, movies, music, military, history.

*Copy, open new tab, quotation mark, paste, quotation mark, enter.*

Every time I encountered a new expression I wasn’t familiar with, I would stop the reading, Google it, and derail a bit from the original article — to make sure I understood the origins of that particular term.

Learning about UX was a much more nonlinear process than I thought. At the same time, much more exciting than just reading about wireframes.

Ultimately, you’re in a journey of learning about people.

## It’s all about passion

The same mechanism applies to other aspects of one’s career. Whether you are trying to be fluent in a new language, learn a new prototyping tool, immerse yourself in a new culture, or just trying to understand your users — ultimately it’s all about finding the intersection between your short-term objectives and your long-term passions.

In my case, it also took a lot of organization and persistence.

Thank you for reading.
